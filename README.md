## About me
I am a graduate from Telkom University with Bachelor's Degree in Informatics and eager to pursuing a career of Quality Assurance.
I also possess strong communication skills, ability to analyze and solve problems and can work in a team environment.
I have experience as a freelance Web Developer at GMP to develop a website for company profile using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
But because I have great interest in Quality Assurance, I join Bootcamp at Binar to enhance my skills regarding QA tools where I learn automated test using Katalon, Performance Test using Jmeter and documented a Test Case.
I believe my experience and my eagerness to learn and improve can positively improve your company.
